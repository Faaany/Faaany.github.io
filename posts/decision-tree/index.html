          <p>As the name implies, a decision tree is a tree for making decisions, especially, when you have several options to choose from. For example, a bank wants to decide whether it should provide a loan to a specific customer and it has some data about this customer. In this case, the bank could use a decision tree like the one below to make a decision:</p>
<p><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gigezny7t6j30qu0kgtba.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are three major components in a decision tree: decision nodes, leaf nodes and links. Decision node represents a feature. Th decision node at the top of the tree has a special name called <code>root node</code>. In our example, it is the income range of an applicant. The leaf node represents an outcome. It can be categorical and numerical. In our case, it is <code>loan</code>or <code>no loan</code>. The link between nodes represents a decision rule, e.g. the different income range of an applicant.</p>
<p>A loan officer could use his years of experiences and domain knowledge to draw this kind of decision tree. But there is a machine learning approach to do it, namely using data to train a decision tree.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-a-decision-tree">How to build a decision tree?</h2>
<p>Given a training data set with different features and the target variable, the first step of building a decision tree is to decide which feature should be used in the root node. The basic idea is that the feature that best classifies the training data should be used in the root node. But how doe we quantify how well a feature classify the training data? There are two common methods: <strong>Information Gain</strong> and <strong>Gini Index</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of information gain is that the data should have a lower entropy after being split on a feature. First you need to calculate the entropy before splitting. Then calculate the entropies after the split on all possible features in the data. The feature that have the largest difference on entropy (largest information gain) after splitting will be used as the root node.</p>
<p>Gini Index is a metric to measure how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly identified. Therefore, the attribute with lower Gini index after splitting should be preferred. To better understand how Gini Index works on example data, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VeUPuFGJHk&amp;list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF&amp;index=38">this</a> StatQuest video about Decision Tree.</p>
<p>After the feature of the root node is chosen, all we need to do is to repeat the same procedure on every branch until the decision nodes of each branch is finalised.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm  that can be used to solve both regression and classification problems. It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time a decision tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes is incrementally developed. Decision tree can handle both categorical data and numerical data and can tell us the feature importance in the data.</p>
